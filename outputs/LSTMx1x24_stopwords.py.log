Hi, It's a Long one! I brought my 25 yr. old car that I cherish to Danny's car wash to get the works. Oil change, and full Detail done. The first salesman I came upon was nice enough, as he was gouging me for every dollar he could get from me. He bulldozed right over me! I told him I really wanted it to be perfect as I Love my car. He quoted me $750! I balked at that and said I wouldn't pay over $400. (Mind you, I have a 2 dr. Little car!) Then another specialist-oil this time-came over and Told Me that with the age and rollover of the miles on my car, that I'd need synthetic oil change. Which is $50 more, and you can Never go back to basic oil again. I told him, that those are Original miles, Hasn't rolled over. He said, No, probably rolled over a couple times. THEY ARE ORIGINAL MILES. BUT, he didn't listen... they told me it would be done by 4:00pm-5 hrs later. (I had to pick my son up from school, so it Had to be done.) I came back at 4:00, not done til 5:00. Price was still $400, but vents, & windows not cleaned, upholstery not vacuumed or shampooed in back, my chrome rims were black, not even touched. And, overall sucky! I came home and cried, and cleaned my whole car myself. I was worried my partner was going to be mad that I spent so much money, and nothing was done, but a basic car wash, and Wrong oil change!...She was... So, the reason for the 4 star rating, is because she wrote a letter to the owner.(would've given them 5 star if not for the 1st visit!) Apparently, under New ownership now-Not Danny's Family, Now "Jackson's." The manager called us and asked us to please bring it back, and give them another chance. We did. We left my car with them all day, but it was worth it. One of the managers talked us through Everything, he and 2 other managers had been versed on my car. Top to bottom. They did such a Pristine job, and really made us feel special. He said, "Thank you for letting us gain your trust in us." They went Above and Beyond. My car may be old, (with 88,000 Orig. Miles, Thank you!) but it has Always been taken care of, and protected from the elements. My car looks and feels fantastic now! I printed a retraction from my 1st experience with them, on FB even. They deserved it. Truly. Thank You Jackson's!!! We Will be back.

Came in for my chronic knee problem.
Got evaluated.
Dr. Todd Winton took enough time to patiently listen to me & see my condition.

But I didn't really get confidence in his understanding of the condition.
A couple of the pathological/evaluation terms he used were not right (I verified that on the internet afterwards).

Can't comment on the treatment as i didn't undertake it.

George Brazil/Mike Diamond was a total rip off!  My air conditioner was not working correctly and I called them, when they got here they looked around then determined that I had 3 options the cheapest being $560 and the most $8,000.  They said that I needed a new air conditioner because they could not figure out what was wrong with mine.  The next day I was talking to a friend and she said her husband could come over and look at it, well lo and behold he fixed it and for free and no parts needed!!!! So all they really cared about was selling us an conditioner, they basically made a service call in to a hard sell call.  They did offer me a refund after I wrote a complaint.

Good bargain, yes. But as a family restaurant, this place could be a bit cleaner. I was embarrassed that my kid had to see the restrooms the way they were kept. There were plenty of kids around. They should take some time to remove all the grafitti in the restrooms. As far as the food, it was better than expected. As i read the other reviews, i was expecting much less. If the restrooms were kept clean i would have given them 4 stars.

Stay the hell away from the buffet, unless you enjoy eating with other people animals, I sat  down to eat my lunch and low and behold people eating at the buffet is taking there animals up to the buffet as the animals are stiffing all over the food. I ask for the Manager who seem to be not surprise by this as she told me it not just for service animals but your companion( dogs, snakes, rabbits, cats, birds) as well. They are a pet friendly hotel and you are also allowed to have your animal gamble right next to you well playing slot machines. I gamble in this casino at least three times a week and this is my first time ever seeing animals in the casino next to their owners unleashed. This casino have lost my
Business (10k) a year. I rather play in a casino and eat in a casino where I don't have to have worry about tics and fleas jumping all over the place.

I shredded a tire on the freeway and had to put my spare on. I called discount tire the next day and they said they would get back to me, needless to say they never called me back. I called Goodyear tire on Litchfield and talked with David the service manager. He told me they didn't have my tire in stock but he made a few calls and was able to get the 2 tires I needed for the front within a couple hours. Also during the tire exchange David pointed out that the inside tread on my rear tires was worn indicating out of alignment or negative camber. I didn't have the money to do it then so I waited a week till I got paid and immediately called David back to order the other 2 tires for the rear and schedule an alignment. I dropped the car off after the tires arrived and David was there to greet me . He gave me a time frame of about an hour and a half so I returned within the allotted timeframe. David let me know after they replaced the rear tires that the camber in the back was no longer negative and I wouldn't need an alignment which was great !! Because I was looking to spend right around $400.00 for the package and instead walked out with only having to pay $200.00. I highly recommend coming to this service facility as they don't try to sell you things you don't need,are a very helpful and knowledgeable staff, they were quick and thorough with their work and the prices are fair. Go see David at Goodyear tires on Litchfield and western Ave if you ever have any issues with your vehicle.

Mike glover was a great salesman, with that said everyone else there is terrible. The "Manager" has anger issues and has no problem yelling at you and seems to enjoy confrontation. The "finance guy" has no idea what is going on and struggled with the simplest questions, and was not sure how to do his job. If purchasing a used car make sure they let you take it to a mechanic because they leave many issues hidden and hope for the best that you don't find them. 

The only reason that i am giving them two stars is because of Mike, he alone deserves five stars.

This is the place for steaks!  they know their stuff.  It is ridiculous expensive - $60 for a petite filet, without sides.  But it was delicious!  Don't miss the cheese puff pastry that they bring to start and the pretzel bread with appetizers was out of control tasty.

Generally the food was very good. But the service just ruined the night for us.  Slow, slow and a bit of slow to go along with that slow on the side.  

When we arrived there wasn't room for 5 of us on the patio.  There was a table of 4 open, and a table for 5 with 2 people at it.  The waitress was of no help.  Left us standing there trying to figure out if we wanted to go inside or not.  So we nicely asked the 2 men if they would move, as their food had not yet arrived.  This was fine with them.  So we settled in and began to discuss the menu and what to do when our 6th friend arrived.  This was about quarter to 8.   We told her we had a 6th coming and she mentioned maybe we better steal a chair from another table while we could.  When my hubbie arrived he perched himself on the window sill temporarily.  She came took his drink order and then returned with his drink without asking him if he might want a chair.  We asked if we could get a chair for him. She looked around and wasn't sure what to suggest.  We asked if we could snag one of the extra chairs from the table for 4 where the 2 men were sitting. She said no that it was reserved for later.   She then offered to look inside for a chair.  Finally problem solved. 

My hubbie asked if there was any non-alcoholic beer. She said she'd check if they had any.  Then came back with an open one.  It happened to be an O'Doul's.  The one my hubbie really doesn't like.  Oh!  Hubbie took a sip and decided he would just suck it up and drink it.  Seemed logical to me to come by and say what they had and check if he wanted it or not.  Not just bring him one.  It really isn't like ordering a coke and getting a pepsi.  And I'msure she would not have done that if someone had asked what they had on tap and she had to check.  

Anyways, I won't bore everyone further with the blow by blow on how it took us until about 9:30 to get our meal.  She didn't come back to see how our meal was, so my bro in law had to walk his steak back into the restaurant because it was blue rare and he had ordered medium. Was quickly fixed, but we not sure why we bothered as the rest of us were done our meals by the time it arrived.  And we were charged for all of it anyways (weren't expecting it free, but a little something to help make us feel our business was worth something).

What was good - my wild mushroom fetticini.  My hubbie's calamari.  The chicken and ribs.

Oh and they don't take interac. 

Interestingly we left to have dessert elsewhere.  We went over to Murrieta's.  Apparently they are owned by the same people. And it was like night and day.  FANTASTIC service and dessert at Murrieta's (will review separately).

Good bargain, yes. But as a family restaurant, this place could be a bit cleaner. I was embarrassed that my kid had to see the restrooms the way they were kept. There were plenty of kids around. They should take some time to remove all the grafitti in the restrooms. As far as the food, it was better than expected. As i read the other reviews, i was expecting much less. If the restrooms were kept clean i would have given them 4 stars.

Mike glover was a great salesman, with that said everyone else there is terrible. The "Manager" has anger issues and has no problem yelling at you and seems to enjoy confrontation. The "finance guy" has no idea what is going on and struggled with the simplest questions, and was not sure how to do his job. If purchasing a used car make sure they let you take it to a mechanic because they leave many issues hidden and hope for the best that you don't find them. 

The only reason that i am giving them two stars is because of Mike, he alone deserves five stars.

Fat burger is hands down the best fast food burger I have ever eaten.  The quality of beef paired with the perfect combination of condiments makes fat burger a necessity on every Vegas trip.  I suggest at least a double burger with cheese, bacon, and a fried egg.  It's my belief that lettuce has no business on a burger but get it with everything else.  If you follow these instructions and are disappointed you may want to set yourself an appointment with a psychiatrist you just might be crazy.

This is the place for steaks!  they know their stuff.  It is ridiculous expensive - $60 for a petite filet, without sides.  But it was delicious!  Don't miss the cheese puff pastry that they bring to start and the pretzel bread with appetizers was out of control tasty.

New neighbors of indeterminate origin recently moved in next door, and such luxuriously mouthwatering, deeply rich cooking smells issue forth from under their door every eve that I dream of befriending them so that at some point they will invite me over for a homecooked meal, slapping me on the back with gaiety and smiling benevolently as I exclaim with a shimmer of tears in my eyes, that I've never had anything as delicious as what they've cooked in the comfort of their home, just for me.

Well, that will probably never happen because in my apartment complex no one ever acknowledges the existence of another unless there is a Problem.  However, this past Friday I got a scrumptious taste of what that reverie would feel like if made tangible at the Peruvian restaurant Pucapuca.  The square, austere dining salon at that time was relatively empty but immediately the owner (also waiter, maitre d' and cook...in fact I'm pretty sure he was the only one in the whole establishment) filled the place up with his warmth and kindly smiling eyes, immediately making us feel like his favored grandchirren.  When he described the prix-fixe menu though, we just about fell out of our seats: 15 CAD for a starter, entree, hot drink and dessert?? On a Friday night in Mile End in Montreal?? We quickly composed ourselves and took to scrutinizing the menu- for entrees, among us four we got dishes of quail, smothered pork chops, spicy beef stew, and stewed chicken in peanut sauce.  The salads and soups we ordered as starters were satisfying, homey and flavorful.  But the entrees.....! Tabarnak! Each plate came heaving with a non-fussy array of food, a scoop of stewed root veggies, a hill of aromatic rice, a mess of peas, and then the meat front and center.  Our table devolved into a chaotic tangle of forks and knives as we dived into our own and each others' dishes...every one was sublime.  The pork chop, smothered in a tomato and beer sauce, was especially wonderful; the best pork dish I've ever tasted in a restaurant.  Even though we were at breaking point after the dinner, we all wedged in a small slice of cake for dessert.

All this, handled with genuine familial feeling from the delightful owner/chef/waiter... it was quite the dining experience.  I'm sad that my return trips back there will be broken up by months of time.

Not what Mitchell's used to be. There was a hair in my food and the bathrooms were less than clean. For a $70 bill for each of us (once my Salmon was taken off), far from worth it.

I would love for them to be what they used to be.

NEVER AGAIN! (at least not for me...this is a hotel for a different crowd)
For me, the best part about this hotel was that happy hour, which lasts until 8 serves $5 glasses of decent wine.  But you can get that without having to stay here overnight.

I arrived to work being done on the outside of the hotel - apparently some rain damaged the drywall (huh?) so had to drive around the side to park, where there is nobody to direct you to where the front desk is, or heaven forbid be there to help you haul your bags up a flight of stairs.  Later I learned that the elevator down there wasn't just for parking - it could have taken me to the lobby, so again it would've been nice if there was sombody down there to let a newcomer know what is where.  Not much in the way of hospitality - but then again, this is a glorified Holiday Inn.

The lobby is okay in that it's very bright, clean and somewhat hip.  The bar is off to the side where there is also a nice outdoor lounge.  Like other Yelpers, I was a little confused by the two computers in the bar acting as the business center, but whatever.

My room was pretty nice.  I liked the retro, mid century look and feel.  This hotel's big selling point was the hard wood floors but in my opinion, the floors were a HUGE mistake.  Firstly, they are cheap laminate, not hard wood and anybody can tell.  But worst of all, the floors make sound travel from room to room!  I was able to hear everything next to me and above me.  And on this random Wednesday night, my floor and the floor above me was an all night party - I mean college kids running up and down the halls like crazy people, doors slamming (and I mean SLAMMING) and what sounded like a game of marbles above my head  This went on until 4 in the morning..  I think that the low price point and hipsterish feel here makes it the perfect place for a twentysomething crowd, but not a business traveler like me.  Free internet and parking does not make up for the circles under my eyes.  So bottom line is, if I were 22 and partying with my friends, this would be a fantastic hotel.  For work or a romantic weekend in Scottsale, notsomuch.

Generally the food was very good. But the service just ruined the night for us.  Slow, slow and a bit of slow to go along with that slow on the side.  

When we arrived there wasn't room for 5 of us on the patio.  There was a table of 4 open, and a table for 5 with 2 people at it.  The waitress was of no help.  Left us standing there trying to figure out if we wanted to go inside or not.  So we nicely asked the 2 men if they would move, as their food had not yet arrived.  This was fine with them.  So we settled in and began to discuss the menu and what to do when our 6th friend arrived.  This was about quarter to 8.   We told her we had a 6th coming and she mentioned maybe we better steal a chair from another table while we could.  When my hubbie arrived he perched himself on the window sill temporarily.  She came took his drink order and then returned with his drink without asking him if he might want a chair.  We asked if we could get a chair for him. She looked around and wasn't sure what to suggest.  We asked if we could snag one of the extra chairs from the table for 4 where the 2 men were sitting. She said no that it was reserved for later.   She then offered to look inside for a chair.  Finally problem solved. 

My hubbie asked if there was any non-alcoholic beer. She said she'd check if they had any.  Then came back with an open one.  It happened to be an O'Doul's.  The one my hubbie really doesn't like.  Oh!  Hubbie took a sip and decided he would just suck it up and drink it.  Seemed logical to me to come by and say what they had and check if he wanted it or not.  Not just bring him one.  It really isn't like ordering a coke and getting a pepsi.  And I'msure she would not have done that if someone had asked what they had on tap and she had to check.  

Anyways, I won't bore everyone further with the blow by blow on how it took us until about 9:30 to get our meal.  She didn't come back to see how our meal was, so my bro in law had to walk his steak back into the restaurant because it was blue rare and he had ordered medium. Was quickly fixed, but we not sure why we bothered as the rest of us were done our meals by the time it arrived.  And we were charged for all of it anyways (weren't expecting it free, but a little something to help make us feel our business was worth something).

What was good - my wild mushroom fetticini.  My hubbie's calamari.  The chicken and ribs.

Oh and they don't take interac. 

Interestingly we left to have dessert elsewhere.  We went over to Murrieta's.  Apparently they are owned by the same people. And it was like night and day.  FANTASTIC service and dessert at Murrieta's (will review separately).

George Brazil/Mike Diamond was a total rip off!  My air conditioner was not working correctly and I called them, when they got here they looked around then determined that I had 3 options the cheapest being $560 and the most $8,000.  They said that I needed a new air conditioner because they could not figure out what was wrong with mine.  The next day I was talking to a friend and she said her husband could come over and look at it, well lo and behold he fixed it and for free and no parts needed!!!! So all they really cared about was selling us an conditioner, they basically made a service call in to a hard sell call.  They did offer me a refund after I wrote a complaint.

Good bargain, yes. But as a family restaurant, this place could be a bit cleaner. I was embarrassed that my kid had to see the restrooms the way they were kept. There were plenty of kids around. They should take some time to remove all the grafitti in the restrooms. As far as the food, it was better than expected. As i read the other reviews, i was expecting much less. If the restrooms were kept clean i would have given them 4 stars.

Je n'ai pas été séduit par cet endroit. 
Il y a peu de choix à la carte, le café est vraiment très corsé et les serveurs et serveuses pourraient être plus chaleureux, les horaires d'ouverture sont limités et la cuisine ferme tôt.
Conforme à sa façade "alternative" et suivant un pseudo-militantisme intéressé, la maison n'accepte que l'argent liquide comme moyen de paiement. Ceci oblige donc le gentil client à retirer l'argent au distributeur d'à côté... en payant les frais bancaires lui-même. En l'occurrence, 2$ par retrait, soit quasiment le prix du café. 
Sinon, Internet est assez rapide (ce qui vaut la deuxième étoile).

Fat burger is hands down the best fast food burger I have ever eaten.  The quality of beef paired with the perfect combination of condiments makes fat burger a necessity on every Vegas trip.  I suggest at least a double burger with cheese, bacon, and a fried egg.  It's my belief that lettuce has no business on a burger but get it with everything else.  If you follow these instructions and are disappointed you may want to set yourself an appointment with a psychiatrist you just might be crazy./home/phoenix/miniconda3/envs/gpu/lib/python3.6/site-packages/h5py/__init__.py:36: FutureWarning: Conversion of the second argument of issubdtype from `float` to `np.floating` is deprecated.

This is the place for steaks!  they know their stuff.  It is ridiculous expensive - $60 for a petite filet, without sides.  But it was delicious!  Don't miss the cheese puff pastry that they bring to start and the pretzel bread with appetizers was out of control tasty.

Not what Mitchell's used to be. There was a hair in my food and the bathrooms were less than clean. For a $70 bill for each of us (once my Salmon was taken off), far from worth it.

I would love for them to be what they used to be.

Far from authentic Mexican food. Lack of flavor in the asada and Pico de gallo was real disappointing considering the 4.5 star rating. Chips were fresh but so are bagged chips....Dios mio!

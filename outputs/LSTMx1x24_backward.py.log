Generally the food was very good. But the service just ruined the night for us.  Slow, slow and a bit of slow to go along with that slow on the side.  

When we arrived there wasn't room for 5 of us on the patio.  There was a table of 4 open, and a table for 5 with 2 people at it.  The waitress was of no help.  Left us standing there trying to figure out if we wanted to go inside or not.  So we nicely asked the 2 men if they would move, as their food had not yet arrived.  This was fine with them.  So we settled in and began to discuss the menu and what to do when our 6th friend arrived.  This was about quarter to 8.   We told her we had a 6th coming and she mentioned maybe we better steal a chair from another table while we could.  When my hubbie arrived he perched himself on the window sill temporarily.  She came took his drink order and then returned with his drink without asking him if he might want a chair.  We asked if we could get a chair for him. She looked around and wasn't sure what to suggest.  We asked if we could snag one of the extra chairs from the table for 4 where the 2 men were sitting. She said no that it was reserved for later.   She then offered to look inside for a chair.  Finally problem solved. 

My hubbie asked if there was any non-alcoholic beer. She said she'd check if they had any.  Then came back with an open one.  It happened to be an O'Doul's.  The one my hubbie really doesn't like.  Oh!  Hubbie took a sip and decided he would just suck it up and drink it.  Seemed logical to me to come by and say what they had and check if he wanted it or not.  Not just bring him one.  It really isn't like ordering a coke and getting a pepsi.  And I'msure she would not have done that if someone had asked what they had on tap and she had to check.  

Anyways, I won't bore everyone further with the blow by blow on how it took us until about 9:30 to get our meal.  She didn't come back to see how our meal was, so my bro in law had to walk his steak back into the restaurant because it was blue rare and he had ordered medium. Was quickly fixed, but we not sure why we bothered as the rest of us were done our meals by the time it arrived.  And we were charged for all of it anyways (weren't expecting it free, but a little something to help make us feel our business was worth something).

What was good - my wild mushroom fetticini.  My hubbie's calamari.  The chicken and ribs.

Oh and they don't take interac. 

Interestingly we left to have dessert elsewhere.  We went over to Murrieta's.  Apparently they are owned by the same people. And it was like night and day.  FANTASTIC service and dessert at Murrieta's (will review separately).

En général quand j'entends parler de marché je me dis cool
je vais voir des fruits, des légumes et pleins de produit locauxEn plus de
cela quand j'ai vu la façade du bâtiment je me suis dis ce Marché est vraiment
magnifique (refait à neuf on dirait) et lorsque l'on rentre c'est la déception. En effet il n'y a à l'intérieur aucun marché mais plus des
boutiques type souvenir ou autres. C'était je pense un marché dans le temps
mais c'est maintenant plus un lieu touristique qui selon moi n'a d'intérêt que
l'extérieur. Et oui comme il y a plein de boutique tout est fractionné à
l'intérieur et on perd la beauté des voutes et tout : c'est presque trop
moderne à l'intérieur. Bon il faut
relativiser car le bâtiment est tout de même sympa et c'est un lieu à voir car
mythique dans le passé. En plus de cela il y une salle d'exposition au sous sol
donc il y a de quoi voir mais ca ne sert a rien d'apporter de sac de course.

Be sure to schedule your appointments an hour ahead of when you need to see the doctor. Have been here multiple times and always end up waiting 30min-an hour!
Otherwise the doctor and staff are good.

Good bargain, yes. But as a family restaurant, this place could be a bit cleaner. I was embarrassed that my kid had to see the restrooms the way they were kept. There were plenty of kids around. They should take some time to remove all the grafitti in the restrooms. As far as the food, it was better than expected. As i read the other reviews, i was expecting much less. If the restrooms were kept clean i would have given them 4 stars.

This is the place for steaks!  they know their stuff.  It is ridiculous expensive - $60 for a petite filet, without sides.  But it was delicious!

Though I requested that no mercury amalgam be used, Dr. John Busby of Affiliated Dentists placed toxic mercury amalgam under a capped tooth which was an anchor for a bridge. He claimed that it had no mercury. For years after the installation of the bridge and mercury filling my health deteriorated, yet I could not track down the cause until a holistic health practitioner suggested that there may be mercury under the capped tooth ( Mercury is one of the most potent neurotoxins of all the heavy metals and an immunosuppressant.).  I had the bridge removed and a large mercury filling was found.  The biological dentist commented that the surrounding gum tissue had a prominent "mercury tattoo" caused from the mercury leaching into the gum. He also stated that the bridge was of inferior quality ( high nickel content and cheap materials) and had been forced into position, causing it to press into the gum. Upon removal of the bridge, an ulcerated, bleeding area of gum was uncovered. It was the source of discomfort and bleeding I had endured for years ( and non-biological dentists had discounted). A visit to a toxocologist revealed that I had very high levels of forms of mercury used in dental amalgam, as well as nickel. Within a few weeks of the removal of the bridge and amalgam my migraines decreased by 80% and neck pain, lymphatic swelling and fatigue began to reduce. 

          When I went to Dr. Busby's office and requested my patient records, I was told that they had  been "shredded." I asked to speak with Busby as I had questions about the materials he had placed in my mouth. I was denied an opportunity to address my questions to him. 

          I encourage people to do their own research. I have found many journal articles linking breast and prostate cancer to mercury and nickel. The metals leach into the tissues of the mouth and then get into the lymphatic tissue of the neck and eventually to the breast ( which is highly lymphatic).. Beware of fluoride, as well--- Dr. Busby's office was promoting products with fluoride in them ( even for children) when I visited it to retrieve my records.

Hi, It's a Long one! I brought my 25 yr. old car that I cherish to Danny's car wash to get the works. Oil change, and full Detail done. The first salesman I came upon was nice enough, as he was gouging me for every dollar he could get from me. He bulldozed right over me! I told him I really wanted it to be perfect as I Love my car. He quoted me $750! I balked at that and said I wouldn't pay over $400. (Mind you, I have a 2 dr. Little car!) Then another specialist-oil this time-came over and Told Me that with the age and rollover of the miles on my car, that I'd need synthetic oil change. Which is $50 more, and you can Never go back to basic oil again. I told him, that those are Original miles, Hasn't rolled over. He said, No, probably rolled over a couple times. THEY ARE ORIGINAL MILES. BUT, he didn't listen... they told me it would be done by 4:00pm-5 hrs later. (I had to pick my son up from school, so it Had to be done.) I came back at 4:00, not done til 5:00. Price was still $400, but vents, & windows not cleaned, upholstery not vacuumed or shampooed in back, my chrome rims were black, not even touched. And, overall sucky! I came home and cried, and cleaned my whole car myself. I was worried my partner was going to be mad that I spent so much money, and nothing was done, but a basic car wash, and Wrong oil change!...She was... So, the reason for the 4 star rating, is because she wrote a letter to the owner.(would've given them 5 star if not for the 1st visit!) Apparently, under New ownership now-Not Danny's Family, Now "Jackson's." The manager called us and asked us to please bring it back, and give them another chance. We did. We left my car with them all day, but it was worth it. One of the managers talked us through Everything, he and 2 other managers had been versed on my car. Top to bottom. They did such a Pristine job, and really made us feel special. He said, "Thank you for letting us gain your trust in us." They went Above and Beyond. My car may be old, (with 88,000 Orig. Miles, Thank you!) but it has Always been taken care of, and protected from the elements. My car looks and feels fantastic now! I printed a retraction from my 1st experience with them, on FB even. They deserved it. Truly. Thank You Jackson's!!! We Will be back.

My 70 year old mother was getting her very first mammogram, and we first got a referral to get it done at Simon med but after seeing all their awful reviews I decided to look elsewhere and boy am I glad I found Ma'am exams.
They were able to get us an appointment the next day and when we got there there was virtually no wait (sign of an efficiently run office). They have a beautiful and clean office and the staff was friendly and pleasant. The actual test took less than 15 min and there was absolutely no hassle.
We paid out of pocket and their price was even a couple of dollars cheaper than simon med!
I VERY MUCH HIGHLY recommend their services.

Came in for my chronic knee problem.
Got evaluated.
Dr. Todd Winton took enough time to patiently listen to me & see my condition.

But I didn't really get confidence in his understanding of the condition.
A couple of the pathological/evaluation terms he used were not right (I verified that on the internet afterwards).

Can't comment on the treatment as i didn't undertake it.

George Brazil/Mike Diamond was a total rip off!  My air conditioner was not working correctly and I called them, when they got here they looked around then determined that I had 3 options the cheapest being $560 and the most $8,000.  They said that I needed a new air conditioner because they could not figure out what was wrong with mine.  The next day I was talking to a friend and she said her husband could come over and look at it, well lo and behold he fixed it and for free and no parts needed!!!! So all they really cared about was selling us an conditioner, they basically made a service call in to a hard sell call.  They did offer me a refund after I wrote a complaint.

Good bargain, yes. But as a family restaurant, this place could be a bit cleaner. I was embarrassed that my kid had to see the restrooms the way they were kept. There were plenty of kids around. They should take some time to remove all the grafitti in the restrooms. As far as the food, it was better than expected. As i read the other reviews, i was expecting much less. If the restrooms were kept clean i would have given them 4 stars.

I shredded a tire on the freeway and had to put my spare on. I called discount tire the next day and they said they would get back to me, needless to say they never called me back. I called Goodyear tire on Litchfield and talked with David the service manager. He told me they didn't have my tire in stock but he made a few calls and was able to get the 2 tires I needed for the front within a couple hours. Also during the tire exchange David pointed out that the inside tread on my rear tires was worn indicating out of alignment or negative camber. I didn't have the money to do it then so I waited a week till I got paid and immediately called David back to order the other 2 tires for the rear and schedule an alignment. I dropped the car off after the tires arrived and David was there to greet me . He gave me a time frame of about an hour and a half so I returned within the allotted timeframe. David let me know after they replaced the rear tires that the camber in the back was no longer negative and I wouldn't need an alignment which was great !! Because I was looking to spend right around $400.00 for the package and instead walked out with only having to pay $200.00. I highly recommend coming to this service facility as they don't try to sell you things you don't need,are a very helpful and knowledgeable staff, they were quick and thorough with their work and the prices are fair. Go see David at Goodyear tires on Litchfield and western Ave if you ever have any issues with your vehicle.

Mike glover was a great salesman, with that said everyone else there is terrible. The "Manager" has anger issues and has no problem yelling at you and seems to enjoy confrontation. The "finance guy" has no idea what is going on and struggled with the simplest questions, and was not sure how to do his job. If purchasing a used car make sure they let you take it to a mechanic because they leave many issues hidden and hope for the best that you don't find them. 

The only reason that i am giving them two stars is because of Mike, he alone deserves five stars.

Fat burger is hands down the best fast food burger I have ever eaten.  The quality of beef paired with the perfect combination of condiments makes fat burger a necessity on every Vegas trip.  I suggest at least a double burger with cheese, bacon, and a fried egg.  It's my belief that lettuce has no business on a burger but get it with everything else.  If you follow these instructions and are disappointed you may want to set yourself an appointment with a psychiatrist you just might be crazy.
